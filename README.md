To determine whether there is evidence of a relationship between bill 
length and bill depth, I will first consider a linear model as there 
appears to be a linear relationship between the two variables. This 
relationship is seen when species is taken into account. The model 
would be: Bill length = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$(Bill depth) + 
$beta_2(Species) + $\epsilon$. 
Following that, I would have to verify assumptions of linear regression 
such as that the residuals are independent and follow a normal distribution.
